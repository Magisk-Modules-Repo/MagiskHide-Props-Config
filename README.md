<a href="https://www.paypal.me/didgeridoohan"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-PayPal-blue.svg"></a> If you find the module useful, please don't hesitate to [support the work involved](https://www.paypal.me/didgeridoohan).

## What's this?
This module is a very complicated way of doing something very simple. Complicated for me, that is... The aim is to make it easy for you, the user. The module changes prop values using the [Magisk resetprop tool](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/blob/master/docs/tools.md#resetprop), something that is very easy to do with a [Magisk boot script](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/blob/master/docs/details.md#magisk-booting-process) and some simple commands. This is very useful for a lot of things, among others to help pass the SafetyNet CTS Profile check on custom and uncertified ROMs. And of course for any normal modification of your device that is done by altering build.prop or similar files.

What this module does is that it adds a terminal based UI for those that don't want (or can't) create a boot script for themselves, making the process of creating such a boot script very simple. With this module I'm also maintaining a list of certified build fingerprints for a number of devices, so that it's easy to pick one you want to use.

## Prerequisites
- Magisk v19+.
- Busybox, preferably @osm0sis' (installable from the Magisk Manager Downloads).


## Installation
Install through the Magisk Manager Downloads section. Or, download the zip from the Manager or the [module support thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/module-magiskhide-props-config-t3789228), and install through the Magisk Manager -> Modules, or from recovery.

The current release is always attached to the OP of the [module support thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/module-magiskhide-props-config-t3789228). Any previous releases can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/releases).


## Usage
After installing the module and rebooting, run the command `props` in a terminal emulator (you can find a one on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) or in the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps)), and follow the instructions to set your desired options. If you use Termux, you'll have to call su before running the command.

You can also run the command with options. Use -h for details.

If you want further details as to what this module does and can do, keep reading. To get an overview of what is available, take a look at the index above. If experiencing issues, take a look at the part about [Issues, support,etc](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#issues-support-etc), and don't forget to provide [logs](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#logs) when asking for help.


## Spoofing device's fingerprint to pass the ctsProfile check
If your device can't pass SafetyNet fully, the CTS profile check fails while basic integrity passes, that means MagiskHide is working on your device but Google doesn't recognise your device as being certified (if basic integrity fails there is nothing this module can do, please check [I can't pass the basicIntegrity check](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#i-cant-pass-the-basicintegrity-check)).

This might be because your device simply hasn't been certified or that the ROM you are using on your device isn't recognised by Google (because it's a custom ROM). 

To fix this, you can use a known working device fingerprint (`ro.build.fingerprint`), one that has been certified by Google, usually from a stock ROM/firmware/factory image, and replace your device's current fingerprint with this. You can also use a fingerprint from another device, but this will change how your device is perceived.

NOTE: If you're using a fingerprint for an Android build after March 16th 2018 you might have to change the security patch date to one that matches the fingerprint used. You can use the [Custom prop](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#changeset-custom-prop-values) function of this module to change `ro.build.version.security_patch` to the desired date. If you don't know the security patch date you can try finding it with trial and error (although it's a much better option to find the actual date from the ROM/firmware/factory image in question). The dates are always either the 1st or the 5th of the month, so try different months one after the other until the CTS profile passes.

There are a bunch of tested certified fingerprints available in the module, just in case you can't get a hold of one for your device. For some devices there are several fingerprints available, for different Android versions. When picking a fingerprint you will also have to pick which version you need. If you have a working fingerprint that could be added to the list, or an updated one for one already on there, please post that in the [module support thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/module-magiskhide-props-config-t3789228) toghether with device details. Please also include the Android security patch date for the factory image/firmware/ROM that the fingerprint comes from.

After having applied a device fingerprint from the module, whenever that particular print is updated in the included prints list, the chosen fingerprint will be automatically updated when the fingerprints list is. Just reboot to apply the new fingerprint. If there are several fingerprints available for the same device, this option only applies for fingerprints of the same Android version. In that case, if you want to update to a newer version you will have to update the fingerprint manually.

If you are using a Treble GSI ROM you can enable the [Use vendor fingerprint](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#use-vendor-fingerprint-for-treble-gsi-roms) option (for more details, see below) in the `Edit device fingerprint` menu.

### Use vendor fingerprint (for Treble GSI ROMs)
When using a Treble GSI ROM with a stock vendor partition, it is possible to use the vendor fingerprint to make the device pass the CTS profile check. Enabling this option will make the module scripts pull the vendor fingerprint on each boot and use this to spoof the device fingerprint. This in turn means you will only have to enable this option once and even if you update your vendor partition the fingerprint used will always be the latest one.

### Matching the Android security patch date
For some devices, if the fingerprint is for an Android build after March 16th 2018, it is necessary to use a security patch date that matches the fingerprint used. For the module provided fingerprints this is done automatically, but if you enter a fingerprint manually you will have to update the security patch date yourself (if they don't already match). Use the [Custom props](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#changeset-custom-prop-values) function of this module to change `ro.build.version.security_patch` to the desired date.

### Can I use any fingerprint?
It's usually possible to use any fingerprint that's certified for your device. It doesn't have to match, either device or Android version. If you don't use a fingerprint for your device, the device might be percieved as the device that the fingerprint belongs to, in certain situations (Play Store, etc). The Android version doesn't matter much, and if you're using a ROM with an Android version much newer than what is officially available for your device, you are going to have to use an older fingerprint if you want to use the one for your device. But, like already stated, that doesn't really matter (most of the time, there might of course be exceptions).

### Finding a certified fingerprint
If you need a certain fingerprint from a device, here are a few tips on how to find it. Also remember that you might need to get the security patch date that corresponds to the fingerprint you find (see [Matching the Android security patch date](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHidePropsConf#matching-the-android-security-patch-date) above).

Also make sure that you get the actual device fingerprint, since there might be props that look similar to what you need. Here's an example, taken from a Google Nexus 6 (named Shamu):
```
google/shamu/shamu:7.1.1/N8I11B/4171878:user/release-keys
```

#### The getprop method
You can get a certified fingerprint for your device by running the getprop command below on a stock ROM/firmware/factory image that fully passes SafetyNet.
```
getprop ro.build.fingerprint
```
If you're already on a custom ROM that can't pass the CTS profile check, this might not be an option... Head over to your device's forum and ask for help. If someone can run the getprop command on their device for you, you're good to go. Or, you can try the other method described below.

*Note that this is the only surefire way of getting the proper fingerprint.*

#### The stock ROM/firmware/factory image method
Another way to find a certified fingerprint is to download a stock ROM/firmware/factory image for your device and extract the fingerprint from there.

*Note that this is possibly not the best way of finding the fingerprint. Using getprop is always preferred.*
The main problem is that it might be hard to find the actual, certified fingerprint since there might also be other similar props that aren't certified. The above mentioned getprop method is always preferred...

You can find the file to download in your device's forum on XDA Developers (either as a firmware file, a proper stock ROM, or in the development section as a debloated stock ROM), from the manufacturer's website, or elsewhere on the great interweb (just remember to be careful when downloading unknown files, it's dangerous to go alone!).

Once you have the file downloaded, there are several different ways that the fingerprint can be found. In all cases you'll have to access the file somehow, and in most cases it's just a matter of unpackaging it. After that it depends on how the package is constructed.

- Sometimes there'll be a build.prop file directly in the zip/package. You might find the fingerprint in there.
- For some devices you'll have to unpack the system.img to get to the build.prop or default.prop file, where you might find the info you want.This can sometimes be done with a simple archive app/program, but sometimes more advanced utilities are needed. On Windows, you can use something like [this tool](https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=57742855&postcount=42). You'll also find more info in the [main thread for that post](https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/software-hacking/how-to-conver-lollipop-dat-files-to-t2978952).
- Other times you'll find the fingerprint in META-INF\com\google\android\updater-script. Look for "Target:" and you'll likely find the fingerprint there.
- Etc... Experiment, the fingerprint will be in there somewhere. 

#### The firmware.mobi method
Sometimes you can also find up to date and certified fingerprints at [firmware.mobi](https://desktop.firmware.mobi/).

### Custom fingerprints list
You can add your own fingerprint to the list by placing a file, named `printslist` (no file extension), in the root of your internal storage with the fingerprints. It needs to be formated as follows: `device name=fingerprint`. The fingerprints added to this list will be found under the `Custom` category in the fingerprints menu. If you create the printslist file in Windows, make sure that you use a text editor that can handle [Unix file endings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline), such as Notepad++ and similar editors (not regular Notepad).
Here's an example:
```
Google Nexus 6=google/shamu/shamu:7.1.1/N8I11B/4171878:user/release-keys
```
NOTE: If you're using a fingerprint for an Android build after March 16th 2018 you might have to change the security patch date to one that matches the fingerprint used. This can be done directly in the fingerprints list, by adding two underscores directly followd by the date at the end of the fingerprint (`__2018-09-05`). You can also use the [Custom props](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#changeset-custom-prop-values) function of this module to change `ro.build.version.security_patch` to the desired date. If you don't know the security patch date you can try finding it with trial and error. The dates are always either the 1st or the 5th of the month, so try different months one after the other until the CTS profile passes.


### I still can't pass the ctsProfile check
If you've picked a certified fingerprint from the provided list, or you're using a fingerprint that you know is certified but still can't pass the ctsProfile check, try one or more of the following:
- First, do you pass basicIntegrity? If you don't, there's something else going on that this module can't help you with. Take a look under ["Miscellaneous MagiskHide issues"](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#miscellaneous-magiskhide-issues) below.
- Go to the "Edit fingerprints menu", select "Boot stages", and start by changing the security patch date boot stage to either default or post-fs-data. If that doesn't work, also try changing the fingerprint boot stage to post-fs-data. The default boot stage can also be changed if you go into the script options and change the boot stage to post-fs-data. See ["Boot stage"](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config#boot-stage) below.
- Try a different fingerprint (pick one from the provided list).
- If you're not using one of the fingerprints provided in the module, make sure you have a matching security patch date set in [Custom props](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#changeset-custom-prop-values). See ["Matching the Android security patch date"](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHidePropsConf#matching-the-android-security-patch-date) above.
- Some ROMs will just not be able to pass the ctsProfile check, if they contain signs of a rooted/modified device that Magisk can't hide, or that they are built in a way that makes it impossible to pass SafetyNet. Check in your ROM thread or with the creator/developer.
- You might have remnants of previous modifications that trigger SafetyNet on your device. A clean install of your system may be required.
- If you can't get things working, and want help, make sure to provide logs and details. See ["Logs"](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config#logs) below.


## Keeping your device "certified"
If you're using a custom ROM, the chances of it being [perceived as uncertified by Google](https://www.xda-developers.com/google-blocks-gapps-uncertified-devices-custom-rom-whitelist/) are pretty high. If your ROM has a build date older than March 16 2018, this might mean that you can't even log into your Google account or use Gapps without [whitelisting your device with Google](https://www.google.com/android/uncertified/) first.

Magisk, and this module, can help with that.

Before setting up your device, install Magisk, this module and use the configuration file described below to pass the ctsProfile check. This should make your device be perceived as certified by Google and you can log into your Google account and use your device without having to whitelist it. Check [here](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/common/prints.sh) for usable fingerprints (only use the part to the right of the equal sign).

If you're having issues getting your device certified, take a look in the Magisk troubleshooting guide linked below.

In case you can't get the Play Store to report your device as "certified", see ["Issues"](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config#issues-support-etc) below.

## Current fingerprints list version
The fingerprints list will update without the need to update the entire module. Keep an eye on the [module support thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/module-magiskhide-props-config-t3789228) for info.

Just run the `props` command and the list will be updated automatically. Use the -nw option to run the script without updating the list or disable it completely in the script settings (see ["Prop script settings"](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config#prop-script-settings) below). If you've disabled the this setting you can update the list manually in the `Edit device fingerprint` menu or by running the `props` command with the -f option.

If you already have a device fingerprint set by the module, and it has been updated in the current fingerprints list, it will be automatically updated when the prints list gets an update. Just reboot to apply. This function can be turned of in the script settings (see ["Prop script settings"](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config#prop-script-settings) below)

**_Current fingerprints list version - v63_**


## Please add support for device X
Adding device fingerprints to the list relies heavily on the users. You guys. I've looked up a fingerprint from time to time, but it is a bit time consuming and I don't have that time...
	
If you want a specific device fingerprint to be added to the module, see [Finding a certified fingerprint](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#finding-a-certified-fingerprint) above. If you can find a fingerprint for the device you have in mind, post it in the thread. I'll test it out and if it passes the ctsProfile check I'll add it to the list. Please also include the Android security patch date for the factory image/firmware/ROM that the fingerprint comes from.


## Please update fingerprint X
Fingerprints included in the module are updated once in a while. Mainly if a user (that's you) provides the updated fingerprint, but sometimes I do look up new fingerprints on [firmware.mobi](https://desktop.firmware.mobi). That is purely based on how much time I have on my hands and how bored I am though...

If you have an updated fingerprint available (and you've posted it for me to update the list), but I haven't yet updated the fingerprints list (which might be a while depending on how much IRL stuff I have to do), it is still perfectly possible for you to use the updated fingerprint.

You can enter the fingerprint manually in the `Edit device fingerprint` menu in the module, you can use the [configuration file](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHidePropsConf#configuration-file), or you can make a [custom fingerprints list](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHidePropsConf#custom-fingerprints-list).


## Device simulation
**_NOTE! This feature is not needed to pass SafetyNet's CTS profile test and may even cause issues. Only enable it if you actually need it, !_**

If you want to simulate a specific device (to get access to device specific apps in the Play store, as an example), you can activate this option. It will pull information from the currently used fingerprint (has to be set by the module) and use this to set a few certain props to these values. The props that can be set are (currently):
- ro.product.brand
- ro.product.name
- ro.product.device
- ro.build.version.release
- ro.build.id
- ro.build.version.incremental
- ro.build.version.sdk

By default all props are set when this option is activated, but it is possible to deactivate and activate each prop individually.

Whenever a fingerprint is set by the module, the `ro.build.description` prop will be set automatically independently from if the general device simulation option is enabled or not.


## Improved root hiding - Editing build.prop and default.prop
In some rare cases, apps and services look at the actual files (build.prop and default.prop), rather than the set prop values. With this module feature you can make sure that the actual prop in build.prop and default.prop is changed to match whatever value the prop has been set to by either MagiskHide or the module. If there's a prop value set by the module (see ["Set/reset MagiskHide Sensitive props"](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config#setreset-magiskhide-sensitive-props) below), that value takes precedence.


## Set/reset MagiskHide Sensitive props
By default, if MagiskHide detects certain sensitive prop values they will be changed to known safe values. These are currently:
- ro.debuggable (set to "0" by MagiskHide - sensitive value is "1")
- ro.secure (set to "1" by MagiskHide - sensitive value is "0")
- ro.build.type (set to "user" by MagiskHide - sensitive value is "userdebug")
- ro.build.tags (set to "release-keys" by MagiskHide - sensitive value is "test-keys" or "dev-keys")
- ro.build.selinux (set to "0" by MagiskHide - sensitive value is "1")

If, for some reason, you need one or more of these to be kept as their original value (one example would be resetting ro.build.type to userdebug since some ROMs need this to work properly), you can reset to the original value with this module. Keep in mind that this might trigger some apps looking for these prop values as a sign of your device being rooted.


## Change/set custom prop values
It's quite easy to change prop values with Magisk. With this module it's even easier. Just enter the prop you want to change and the new value and the module does the rest, nice and systemless. Any changes that you've previously done directly to build.prop, default.prop, etc, you can now do with this module instead. If you have a lot of props that you want to change it'll be a lot easier to use the [configuration file](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#configuration-file) (see below).

When setting a custom prop you can also pick in what boot stage it should be set in. This can also be changed later for each individual custom prop. There are three options:
- Default - The main module option will decide (see [Prop script settings](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#boot-stage) below).
- post-fs-data - The prop will always be set in post-fs-data, regardless of the main module option.
- late_start service - The prop will always be set in late_start service, regardless of the main module option.
- Both post-fs-data late_start service - In some special cases you would want the prop to be set during both boot stages. An example would be if the system reapplies the stock prop value late in the boot process (after post-fs-data).

Note: post-fs-data runs earlier than late_start service.

### My build.prop doesn't change after setting a custom prop
Magisk doesn't alter the build.prop file when changing a custom prop value, it simply loads the new value instead of the one in build.prop. If you want to check if the new value has been loaded you can see this by selecting the prop in the "Add/edit custom props" menu of the `props` script.

You can also use the `getprop` command in a terminal emulator to check the set value. Example:
```
getprop ro.build.fingerprint
```


## Removing prop values
If you would like to delete a certain prop value from your system, that can be done with the [Magisk resetprop tool](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/blob/master/docs/tools.md#resetprop). With this module you can easily set that up by adding whatever prop you want removed to the "Delete props" list. Be very careful when using this option, since removing the wrong prop may cause isses with your device. See ["Device issues because of the module"](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config#device-issues-because-of-the-module) below if this happens.

### My build.prop doesn't change after removing a prop value
Magisk doesn't alter the build.prop file when removing a prop value, it simply prevents the prop to load instead of removing it from build.prop. If you want to check if the prop has been removed use the `getprop` command in a terminal emulator to check. Example:
```
getprop ro.build.fingerprint
```
If the prop has been removed, the command should return nothing.


## Prop script settings
There are a couple of persistent options that you can set for the `props` script. These are currently "Boot stage", "Script colours" and "Fingerprints list check". The options are found under "Script settings" when running the `props` script. The settings menu can also be opened by using the -s option (use -h for details).

### Boot stage
It's possible to move the execution of the boot script from the default system.prop file to either post-fs-data or late_start service. If there are any kind of issues during boot or that props don't set properly, try changing the boot stage to either post-fs-data or late_start service instead. Just keep in mind that this might cause other issues like the fingerprint not setting properly (if set during late_start service) or that post-fs-data will be interupted by having too many props causing the script to run too slow.

It is also possible to set individual props, like fingerprint, security patch date and custom props individualy. There'll be an option under the corresponding menu.

Note: post-fs-data runs earlier than system.prop and late_start service runs after, right at the end of the boot process. Having to many props set in post-fs-data may have an adverse effect on the boot process. Using the default system.prop file or late_start service is prefered if possible.

### Script colours
This option will disable or enable colours for the `props` script.

### Fingerprints list check
This option will disable or enable the automatic updating of the fingerprints list when the `props` script starts. If the fingerprints list check is disabled, the list can be manually updated from within the script, under the `Edit device fingerprint` menu, or with the -f option (use -h for details).

### Automatic fingerprint update
Whenever there is an update to the fingerprints list and if you have a fingerprint applied for a device that is on the list, the fingerprint will automatically be updated (if there is an update to that particular fingerprint). This option will not update a fingerprint to one for a different Android version if there are several fingerprints available for the same device.

## Configuration file
You can use a configuration file to set your desired options, rather than running the `props` command. This is particularly useful if you have a large amount of custom props you want to set. Download the [settings file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/master/common/propsconf_conf) or extract it from the module zip ('propsconf_conf' in the common folder), fill in the desired options (follow the instructions in the file), place it /data or /cache (or /data/cache if you're using an A/B device) and reboot. You can also use the configuration file when first installing the module. Just place the file in the root of your internal storage (or one of the other previously mentioned locations) before flashing the module and the installation script will set everything up.

If you edit the configuration file in Windows, make sure that you use a text editor that can handle [Unix file endings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline), such as Notepad++ and similar editors (not regular Windows Notepad).

This can also be done directly at the first install (through Manager or recovery) and even on a brand new clean install of Magisk, before even rebooting your device (also see "Setting up the module on a clean Magisk/ROM flash" below).

**NOTE!** Upon detecting the file, the module installation/boot script will load the configured values into the module and then delete the the configuration file, so keep a copy somewhere if you want to use the same settings later.

### Setting up the module on a clean Magisk/ROM flash
After having made a clean ROM flash, the configuration file can be used to set the module up as you want without even having to boot first. First flash the ROM and Magisk. After that you can place the configuration file (see above) with your desired settings (fingerprint, custom props, etc) in the root of your internal storage (/sdcard), /data or /cache (or /data/cache if you're using an A/B device) and then install the module. This will set the module up just as you want it without having to do anything else. It is also possible to place the configuration file after having installed the module and rebooting (although you can only use /data or /cache as a location for the file, /sdcard will not be mounted in time). This will set everything up during boot, but it is possible that this won't work an all device/ROM combinations. If you experience issues, let the ROM boot once before setting everything up.


## Miscellaneous MagiskHide issues
If you're having issues passing SafetyNet, getting your device certified, or otherwise getting MagiskHide to work, take a look in the [Magisk and MagiskHide Installation and Troubleshooting Guide](https://www.didgeridoohan.com/magisk). Lots of good info there (if I may say so myself)...

But first: have you tried turning it off and on again? Toggling MagiskHide off and on usually works if MagiskHide has stopped working after an update of Magisk or your ROM.


## Issues, support, etc
If you have questions, suggestions or are experiencing some kind of issue, visit the [module support thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/module-magiskhide-props-config-t3789228) @ XDA.

### Known issues
- EdXposed sometimes causes Magisk's boot process to fail, resulting in the module boot scripts (mainly service.sh) not running as they should. Until this has been fixed with EdXposed, there are a couple of ways to work around this. Use the [Configuration file](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#configuration-file) to set everything up during installation, or disable EdXposed before setting the module up and enable it again after the module works as you want it. Just make sure to use the default settings for boot stages.

### Requires Magisk v19+
If the module won't install, with the message that Magisk v19+ is required, but you have Magisk v19+ installed, that means that your Magisk installation is broken. It's likely that you did not update properly (always update directly from the Manager) from a previous Magisk version (or something along those lines) and core parts of Magisk are still from an old install. The solution is to do a reinstallation by using "Direct install" in the Magisk Manager. If you for some reason can't do a direct install you're likely going to have to uninstall Magisk and start over.

### An option is marked as "disabled"
A couple of the options in the `props` script will be automatically disabled in some circumstances. These are:  
- _"Edit device fingerprint"_ will be disabled if another Magisk module that is known to also edit the device fingerprint is installed.
- _"Device simulation"_ will be disabled if there is no device fingerprint set by the module.
- _"Improved hiding"_ will be disable if all relevant prop values already are "safe" (in other words: the option isn't needed), or if a conflicting module that also Magic Mounts build.prop is found.

### I can't pass the ctsProfile check
See ["I still can't pass the ctsProfile check"](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#i-still-cant-pass-the-ctsprofile-check) above.

Also see ["Props don't seem to set properly"](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#props-dont-seem-to-set-properly) below.

### I can't pass the basicIntegrity check
This module can usually only really help with the ctsProfile check, by spoofing the device fingerprint. If you can't pass basicIntegrity, there's probably something else going on with your device, but there is a possibility that changing the device fingerprint can make this pass as well. If you can't get things working, see ["Miscellaneous MagiskHide issues"](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#miscellaneous-magiskhide-issues) above.

### Props don't seem to set properly
If it seems like props you're trying to set with the module don't get set properly (ctsProfile still doesn't pass, custom props don't work, etc), go into the script options and change the boot stage at which the props are being set, or change the boot stage for that particular prop, to late_start service. See ["Boot stage"](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config#boot-stage) or ["Custom prop values"](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#changeset-custom-prop-values) above. This might happen because the particular prop you're trying to set get assigned it's value late in the boot process and by setting the boot stage for the prop to the last one available (late_start service) you optimise the chances of the module setting the prop after the system.

### My device's Android security patch date changed
For some fingerprints it is necessary to also change the security patch date to match the fingerprint used (the actual patch won't change, just the displayed date). This is automatically done by the module when using a fingerprint from a build after March 16 2018. If you do not want this to happen you can manually add `ro.build.version.security_patch` to the custom props and load back the original date, but keep in mind that this may result in the fingerprint not working and SafetyNet will fail.

### Device issues because of the module
A common reason for issues with booting the device or with system apps force closing, etc, is having enabled [Device simulation](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHidePropsConf/blob/master/README.md#device-simulation). This feature is not needed for passing SafetyNet's CTS profile check. Only enable it if you actually need it, and keep in mind that it may cause issues when activated.

In case of issues, if you've set a prop value that doesn't work on your device causing it not to boot, etc, don't worry. There are options. You can follow the advice in the [Magisk troubleshooting guide](https://www.didgeridoohan.com/magisk/Magisk#hn_Module_causing_issues_Magisk_functionality_bootloop_loss_of_root_etc) to remove or disable the module, or you can use the module's built-in options to reset all module settings to the defaults.

Place a file named `reset_mhpc` in /cache (or /data/cache on A/B devices) and reboot.

It is possible to use this in combination with the [configuration file](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#configuration-file) described above to keep device fingerprint or any other settings intact past the reset. Just make sure to remove any custom props that might have been causing issues from the configuration file.

### The Play Store is "uncertified"
If your device's Play Store reports that the device is "uncertified", this is usually fixed by making sure that you pass SafetyNet and then clearing data for the Play Store (and possibly rebooting). More details in the [Magisk troubleshooting guide](https://www.didgeridoohan.com/magisk/MagiskHide#hn_Device_uncertified_in_Play_storeNetflix_and_other_apps_wont_install_or_doesnt_show_up).

## Logs
In case of issues, please provide the logs by running the `props` script and selecting the "Collect logs" option (or running the `props` script with the -l option, use -h for details). All the relevant logs and module files, together with the Magisk log, the stock build.prop file and current prop values will be packaged into a file that'll be stored in the root of the device's internal storage, ready for attaching to a post in the [module support thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/module-magiskhide-props-config-t3789228), together with a detailed description of your problem.

The logs will also automatically be saved to the root of the device's internal storage if there's an issue with the module scripts.

If there are issues with other apps or your system as a result of using this module, a logcat/recovery log/etc showing the issue will most likely be necessary. Take a look in my [Magisk troubleshooting guide](https://www.didgeridoohan.com/magisk/MagiskHelp) for guidance on that.

### Collecting logs manually
If you can't run the `props` script for some reason, the logs are also stored in /cache (or /data/cache for A/B devices). The Magisk log and any files starting with "propsconf" would be useful for troubleshooting (if you don't, or can't, use the "Collect logs" option mentioned above). Providing the output from terminal might also be useful.


## Donations
If you've had any help from me or this module, any kind of [donation](https://forum.xda-developers.com/donatetome.php?u=4667597) to support the work involved would of course be appreciated.

- Added two new devices to the fingerprints list, Oppo Neo 7 and Xiaomi Mi 9. List updated to v52.

### v4.0.0  
- Updated to the new module template. Otherwise the same as v3.5.2, apart from some code cleanup.
- Due to some of the code cleanup and the new template, this release is only compatible with Magisk v19+. Users not updating to Magisk v19+ can use module v3.5.2.
- New (Samsung Galaxy A6 Plus and Tab S3, Xiaomi Mi Note 3) and updated (Essential PH-1, Google Pixel and Pixel XL 1-3 and Pixel C, OnePlus 5T and Xiaomi Mi A2 and Pocophone F1) fingerprints added. List at v51.

### v3.5.2  
- Fixed a bug where automatic update of the applied fingerprint during installation would cause the installation to fail.

### v3.5.1  
- Fix a few bugs causing props not setting properly at boot in some cases when using the system.prop boot stage.
- Moved ro.build.version.security_patch to late_start service by default, so as not to cause issues for devices with Keymaster 4 (possible source of bootloops). Thank you @Nebrassy.

Several fingerprints have been updated with dual fingerprints.
- Updated and optimised when props are set during boot. Uses Magisk's system.prop function by default, rather than post-fs-data, to avoid putting a strain on the system during boot. At what boot stage props are set can of course be completely configured by the user (see the documentation for details).
- Updated the configuration file to match current settings (see the documentation for details). Update your personal files to match.
- Fixed a bug where the props file wouldn't get the proper permissions when using the configuration file on a clean install.
